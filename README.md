This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# FIRST NEXT APP:

Hi there.
I'll show you about the next.js project I made. here I make a store app like e-commerce but not the same as it. Yeah about I think 30% the same as e-commerce.. :v

# What is the feature? :key:

for now, this application has 2 sections, what it is:

A. Admin Dashboard
as we know here make admin can Create, Read, Update, and Delete data.

B. Customer
For now, customers just look around for products on the website.

# Get from where data product?

Here I have 2 products, Shoes and Clothes

1.  For shoes data comes from my database which is from input by the admin
2.  and clothes I get from public API (https://unsplash.com/developers)

and I must thank you Unsplash for the API because made me quickly create this project :D

# Tech Stack?

1.  Tailwind CSS
2.  Axios
3.  Redux Toolkit
4.  Mysql2
5.  Sequelize
6.  and Typescript

# Next development ?

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
